# ChatGPT

This repository contains code for a ChatGPT application that utilizes OpenAI's language model to provide conversational responses. The application is built using Streamlit, a Python library for building interactive web applications.

## Installation

To run the ChatGPT application, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed.
3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up your OpenAI API key by creating a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and adding the following line:

```shell
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key.

## Usage

Once you have completed the installation steps, you can run the ChatGPT application by executing the following command in your terminal:

```shell
streamlit run main.py
```

This will start the application and open a web browser window with the interface.

## Application Interface

The application interface consists of a text input field where you can enter your question or input. Once you enter your question and press Enter or click outside the input field, the application will send your question to the ChatGPT model and display the response on the screen.

The conversation history is displayed below the input field, showing both user inputs and model responses.

## About the Model

The ChatGPT model used in this application is a large language model trained by OpenAI. It is designed to assist with various tasks, including answering questions and engaging in natural-sounding conversations. The model uses the input it receives to generate human-like text responses that are coherent and relevant to the conversation.

The model is constantly learning and improving, and its capabilities are regularly updated. It can process and understand large amounts of text and provide accurate and informative responses on a wide range of topics.
